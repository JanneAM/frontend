            <em>(Hamlet, Act III, Scene I)</em>
            
            
            
            
            
        <p>To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
            Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
            Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>
            And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br>
            No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
            The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
            That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br>
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
            To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br>
            For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
            Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
            That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
            For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
            The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
            The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br>
            The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
            That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
            When he himself might his quietus make<br>
            With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
            To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
            But that the dread of something after death,<br>
            The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br>
            No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
            And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
            Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
            Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
            And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
            Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
            And enterprises of great pith and moment<br>
            With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>
            And lose the name of action.â€”Soft you now!<br>
            The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
            Be all my sins remember'd.</p>
